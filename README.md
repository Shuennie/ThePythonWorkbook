I'm self taught mainly using Python for Everybody via FreeCodeCamp. Thanks Charles Severence for teaching me Python! 

This Github page is for me to document my answers as I go through the Python Workbook by Ben Stephenson. 

If you come across this I hope you find it useful, if you see that there's a better way of writing the code, please let me know as I'm always keen to improve. 

Cheers all, 
Shuennie from Melbourne, Australia
